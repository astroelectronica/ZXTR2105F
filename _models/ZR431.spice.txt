*ZETEX ZR431 Spice Model v1.0 Last Revised 31/3/2005
*              
*NOTE: This is a simplified Model.  Do not rely on this Model for 
*validation of circuit stability.  It does not accurately replicate 
*stability boundary conditions with additional load capacitance.  
*Check stability by normal breadboarding techniques.
